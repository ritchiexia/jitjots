          <h2>Design Team</h2>
          <p>
            The design team is responsible for designing the structure of
            science workshops, including activities, slideshows, videos, and
            more! You will also be responsible for researching interesting and
            cool science subjects that can be presented in our workshops. Do not
            think that you are confined in terms of what you are allowed to
            plan. Let your imagination and creativity run wild!

          <h2>Communications Team</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the communications team, your role is to enhance the
            presence of Jit Jots across various social media platforms as well
            as market upcoming events and notices of importance. Communications
            volunteers are expected to use graphic design softwares such as
            Canva to create visually appealing graphics to be posted on Jit
            Jotsâ€™ social media. Other tasks may include editing newsletters,
            logging volunteer hours, and video editing. Ultimately, the biggest
            perk of being a communications volunteer is the flexibility and
            openness in terms of responsibilities.

          <h2>Outreach Team</h2>
          <p>
            The community outreach team is broadly responsible for developing
            and maintaining Jit Jots relationships with other organizations,
            daycares, recreational centers, community programs, and sponsors.
            Typical tasks include finding new sponsors, creating fundraisers,
            and reaching out to daycares and afterschool programs. The outreach
            team will also be working very closely with the design team to
            organize and schedule workshop presentation dates. The role is very
            flexible and there is definitely room to take on bigger initiatives!
