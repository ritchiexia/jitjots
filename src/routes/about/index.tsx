        <p>
          Jit Jots is a non-profit organization founded by a group of UBC
          students in the faculty of science. Our mission is to share our
          passion for the subject, and hope to inspire a positive learning
          environment for the youth in our community. We strive to make learning
          fun through weekly activity sheets and online workshops where we will
          guide kids through exciting experiments they can do at home and
          interactive quizzes!
        </p>

        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>
          Jit Jots workshops aim to present various science topics through fun
          activities and engaging demonstrations. From dry ice bubbles to
          extracting DNA from strawberries, children can expect to participate
          in various science plays! Workshops are typically an hour long, but
          can be booked for longer upon requests. Workshops can be booked in
          advance and are completely free.
